# Injection Guide Deployment Check

## Date: 2025-10-31

### Investigation Summary

#### ✅ Code Status
- **Injection Guide Implementation**: COMPLETE
  - Location: `src/components/PHAPropertiesDashboard.jsx` (lines 754-1318)
  - Feature: "사출 가이드" (Injection Guide) tab with 6 sub-sections
  - Content: Machine settings, calculators, process flow, checklist, troubleshooting

- **Git Status**: MERGED TO MAIN
  - PR #32: Added injection guide (commit c3a67f8)
  - PR #33: Fixed bugs including division by zero and dynamic Tailwind classes (commit b7e97d8)
  - Current main branch commit: dd214c5

- **Build Status**: SUCCESS
  - Local build completed successfully
  - Injection guide text verified in build output (`dist/assets/*.js`)
  - No build errors or warnings (except chunk size)

#### ❓ Deployment Issue
- **Problem**: Injection guide not visible on https://nkkks-pha-process-v1.netlify.app/
- **Main branch**: Contains all injection guide code (dd214c5)
- **Local build**: Works perfectly

### Possible Causes

1. **Netlify Not Auto-Deploying**
   - Netlify may not have automatically deployed the latest main branch commit
   - Manual deployment trigger may be needed

2. **Browser Cache**
   - Old cached version may be showing
   - Hard refresh needed (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

3. **Netlify Configuration**
   - Build branch setting may point to different branch
   - Build command or publish directory may be misconfigured

### Recommended Actions

1. **Check Netlify Dashboard**
   - Go to https://app.netlify.com/
   - Find the site "nkkks-pha-process-v1"
   - Check latest deployment status
   - Verify deploy branch is set to "main"

2. **Trigger Manual Deploy**
   - In Netlify dashboard: Deploys → Trigger deploy → Deploy site
   - Or: Deploys → Click on latest deploy → Retry deploy

3. **Clear Browser Cache**
   - Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   - Or: Clear browser cache entirely

4. **Verify Netlify Build Settings**
   - Build command: `npm ci && npm run build` (as per netlify.toml)
   - Publish directory: `dist`
   - Deploy branch: `main`
   - Node version: 18.20.4

### Build Configuration (netlify.toml)
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm ci && npm run build"
  publish = "dist"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18.20.4"
```

### Next Steps
1. Check Netlify deployment logs
2. Verify which commit is currently deployed
3. If needed, trigger manual redeploy from Netlify dashboard
